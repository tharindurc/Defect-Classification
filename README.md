# ðŸ§µ Deep Learning for Automated Garment Defect Detection

This repository contains the source code, model architecture, training logs, and supporting material for the research thesis:  
**"Deep Learning-Based Defect Detection in Intimates Clothing Manufacturing"** conducted as part of the Masterâ€™s in Data Science program.

## Project Overview

The garment industry relies heavily on manual inspection processes for quality control, which are often time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone. This project explores deep learning methods to automate defect detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling scalable and real-time quality assurance in manufacturing.

The study focuses on both:
- **Binary classification**: Defective vs. Non-defective garments  
- **Multiclass classification**: Holes, Seam Puckering, Uncut Threads, Raw Edges, Broken Stitches

## Models Implemented

- âœ… **Baseline CNN**  
- ðŸ”§ **Improved CNN** (with Batch Normalization & Dropout)  
- ðŸŒ± **EfficientNetB0** (transfer learning with grayscale support)  
- ðŸ§± **ResNet18** (transfer learning with fine-tuning)

## Key Results

| Model           | Task         | Test Accuracy | F1-Score |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Baseline CNN   | Binary       | 86.59%         | 0.8036   |
| Improved CNN   | Multiclass   | **83.33%**     | **0.8312** |
| EfficientNetB0 | Multiclass   | 79.17%         | 0.7869   |
| ResNet18       | Binary       | **86.59%**     | **0.8567** |
